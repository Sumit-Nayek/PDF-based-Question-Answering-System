# 📘 PDF-based Question-Answering System

This repository contains a smart Question-Answering (QA) system that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask natural language questions based on its content. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based models to extract, process, and generate accurate context-specific answers.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 PDF parsing and text extraction
- 🔍 Chunking and context-aware document segmentation
- 📚 Embedding creation using Sentence Transformers or OpenAI embeddings
- 🤖 Question-answering using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- 💬 Fast and accurate answer generation via pre-trained LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, HuggingFace models)
- 🧠 Optionally supports vector store (e.g., FAISS) for large document retrieval
- 🌐 Streamlit-based or Flask-based interactive web UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- `PyMuPDF` / `pdfplumber` for PDF reading
- `NLTK` / `spaCy` for text processing
- `transformers` and `sentence-transformers` for embeddings
- `FAISS` or `ChromaDB` for vector search
- `LangChain` (optional) for LLM pipeline
- Streamlit / Flask for UI

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **PDF Upload**
The user uploads a PDF file. The system extracts text from all pages.

### 2. **Text Chunking**
The extracted text is split into manageable chunks using sentence boundaries to preserve context.

### 3. **Embedding Creation**
Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or OpenAI's embeddings.

### 4. **Vector Store (Optional)**
Embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to enable fast retrieval.

### 5. **Question Input**
The user types a question in natural language. The system converts it to an embedding.

### 6. **Context Retrieval**
The most relevant chunks are retrieved using cosine similarity between question and text chunk embeddings.

### 7. **Answer Generation**
A pre-trained language model generates the answer using the retrieved context.
